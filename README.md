About the task :-
Task: Create the Decision Tree Classifier and visualize it graphically.
Purpose of the task: If we feed any new data to this Classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

My task was centered around a provided dataset, and I was tasked with uncovering insights and making predictions using Decision Trees. This experience not only allowed me to put my coding skills to the test but also provided valuable insights into the power of machine learning for decision-making.
Here's a sneak peek into what I accomplished: 
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Gained insights into the data distribution, patterns, and relationships. 
3. Model Building: Constructed a Decision Tree model to make predictions. 
4. Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance and made necessary adjustments for optimization.
